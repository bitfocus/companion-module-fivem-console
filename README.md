# companion-module-fivem-console

This module creates a connection to the console server running on a FiveM client, which defaults to using port 29200.

As this module is still in-development there is currently no feedback implemented, as what data is accessible varies greatly depending on what scripts are used on the server. Similarly, because commands can also vary from server to server the presets are currently limited but will be added to over time.

This module, as with Companion, is free and open source, but if you'd like to support the continued development of this and my other modules (vMix, Google Sheets, Twitch, Discord, Voicemeeter, and more) tips will always be appreciated either on [Github](https://github.com/sponsors/thedist) or [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/thedist).
